# MyProjects
All the things that i used in my projects and interview tasks (that are allowed to share of course):
# AWS and yandex infra with ansible
Name says for itself - deploying infrastructure in both providers with ansible.
The idea was to develop an infrastructure solution for both providers with some budget (100 thousand rubles if i'm not mistaken).
Includes excel table with all the data plus some other options.
# react hello world with docker, k8s and helm
Same here for naming - random hello world app on react with some additions (automation i mean).
# storage server
It was some live project, so i had to remove all the sensitive data (code itself for example (spring with maven)), so it looks a bit cut off.
